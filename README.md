BookShare is an easy to use website for organizing a private library
between a small group of people.  With BookShare, you can add your own
contributions to a library by scanning it with your phone.  You can
also locate and request books in the library that currently reside
with other members.

For example, a bookclub can use BookShare to keep track of who
currently has which books on the reading list for the summer.

For example, a language school typically has a very interested, active
community of families, together with a rich but inaccessible trove of
foreign language books.  Bookshare unlocks that treasure for the
language school by making it easy to share and track any book that a
participating member is willing to loan out to the community.

BookShare works best with book archiving apps, such as "My Library".
