            "S": "The last unvanquished piece of England, Wessex is eyed hungrily by the fearsome Viking conquerors. A dispossessed young nobleman, Uhtred is tied to the imperiled land by birth and marriage but was raised by the Danish invaders—and he questions where his allegiance must lie. But blood is his destiny, and when the overwhelming Viking horde attacks out of a wintry darkness, Uhtred must put aside all hatred and distrust and stand beside his embattled country's staunch defender—the fugitive King Alfred. The Pale Horseman is a gripping, monumental adventure that gives breathtaking life to one of the most important epochs in English history—yet another masterwork from New York Times bestselling author Bernard Cornwell."

Some of these qustions are: What are the fluxes of greenhouse gases across the atmospheric interface of ecosystems? How mush carbon is stored in the biomass and soils of the basin? How are elements from the land transferred to the basin's surface waters? What is the sum of elements transferred from land to ocean, and what is its marine \"fate\"? This book of original chapters by experts in chemical and biological oceanography, tropical agronomy and biology, and the atmospheric sciences will address these and other important questions, with the aim of synthesizing the current knowledge of biochemical processes operating within and between the various ecosystems in the Amazon basin."

            "S": "NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY KIRKUS REVIEWS Acclaimed author Elizabeth Moon spins gripping, richly imagined epic fantasy novels that have earned comparisons to the work of such authors as Robin Hobb and Lois McMaster Bujold. In this volume, Moon’s brilliant masterwork reaches its triumphant conclusion. The mysterious reappearance of magery throughout the land has been met with suspicion, fear, and violence. In the kingdom of Lyonya, Kieri, the half-elven, half-human king, struggles to balance the competing demands of his heritage while fighting a deadly threat to his rule: evil elves linked in some way to the rebirth of magic. Meanwhile, in the neighboring kingdom of Tsaia, a set of ancient artifacts recovered by the former mercenary Dorrin Verrakai may hold the answer to the riddle of magery’s return. Thus Dorrin embarks on a dangerous quest to return these relics of a bygone age to their all-but-mythical place of origin. What she encounters there will change her in unimaginable ways—and spell doom or salvation for the entire world. Praise for Crown of Renewal “Mesmerizing . . . [Elizabeth] Moon offers convincingly realized characters persuasively shaped by the extraordinary richness, depth and texture of the world they inhabit. . . . Such is the allure of an extremely talented writer at the the height of her powers.”—Kirkus Reviews (starred review) “Elves, demons, warped magicians, ancient artifacts, time travel, and an agrarian-based society make for an evocative story. . . . The depth of each character’s emotions . . . show the author’s writing power.”—Booklist Praise for Elizabeth Moon Limits of Power “Thoughtful and deeply character driven, full of personal crises as heartbreaking and hopeful as any dramatic invasion . . . Fantasy fans will be delighted by this impressive foray.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review) Echoes of Betrayal “This is an excellent series, and Echoes of Betrayal is particularly well done. [Moon is a] consistently entertaining writer, and this book lives up to her standards.”—San Jose Mercury News “Rousing action and intriguing plot twists.”—Kirkus Reviews Kings of the North “Moon’s characters navigate an intricate maze of alliances and rivalries. . . . Close attention to military detail gives the action convincing intensity.”—The Star-Ledger “Her storytelling is as electrifying as ever, and her readers should be delighted with this new vista of a well-known world.”—Booklist From the Hardcover edition."

I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. My name is Kvothe. You may have heard of me' So begins the tale of Kvothe - currently known as Kote, the unassuming innkeepter - from his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, through his years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a difficult and dangerous school of magic. In these pages you will come to know Kvothe the notorious magician, the accomplished thief, the masterful musician, the dragon-slayer, the legend-hunter, the lover, the thief and the infamous assassin. The Name of the Wind is fantasy at its very best, and an astounding must-read title."

But she is not just any Vampire Huntress, she is the millenium Neteru. A woman so potentially powerful that the vampire world is about to invoke a bloody battle that threatens to spill over onto her streets in order to posses her. It's just a matter of who will get to her first. Fallon Nuit, a rogue vampire, is one of the most powerful Damali has ever encountered and he has allied himself with the deadly Amanrath demons in order to claim her. But the Vampire Council has plans for her as well. And now an unlikely variable has entered into the equation, an ex-lover now turned vampire with an agenda of his own. And she must risk trusting him once more if they are to survive."

Emphasizing the roles of local exhibitors, neighborhood audiences, regional cultures, and the growing national mass media, their essays chart how motion pictures so quickly and successfully moved into old opera houses and glittering new picture palaces on Main Streets across America."

Along with providing biographical material on most of the living Nordic composers, the book discusses in detail the major trends in Scandinavian contemporary music as well as many of the recent musical works. The 800-page volume is edited by John D. White, a former Scholar to Iceland and a Fellow of the American-Scandinavian Foundation. White is the author of Part III, New Music in Iceland and has enlisted five other distinguished Nordic musical scholars to write the remaining sections of the book. Bound together philosophically, geographically, and to a significant extent ethnically, the five Nordic countries hold a unique place in today's world. They are populated by talented, creative achievers, and each nation possesses its own special qualities. This is certainly true in its music, yet little of Nordic tone art of the late twentieth century is widely known outside of Northern Europe. Thus, this comprehensive volume will serve a valuable purpose in disseminating knowledge about this important body of music literature."

            "S": "In Rise to Rebellion, bestselling author Jeff Shaara captured the origins of the American Revolution as brilliantly as he depicted the Civil War in Gods and Generals and The Last Full Measure. Now he continues the amazing saga of how thirteen colonies became a nation, taking the conflict from kingdom and courtroom to the bold and bloody battlefields of war. It was never a war in which the outcome was obvious. Despite their spirit and stamina, the colonists were outmanned and outfought by the brazen British army. General George Washington found his troops trounced in the battles of Brooklyn and Manhattan and retreated toward Pennsylvania. With the future of the colonies at its lowest ebb, Washington made his most fateful decision: to cross the Delaware River and attack the enemy. The stunning victory at Trenton began a saga of victory and defeat that concluded with the British surrender at Yorktown, a moment that changed the history of the world. The despair and triumph of America’s first great army is conveyed in scenes as powerful as any Shaara has written, a story told from the points of view of some of the most memorable characters in American history. There is George Washington, the charismatic leader who held his army together to achieve an unlikely victory; Charles Cornwallis, the no-nonsense British general, more than a match for his colonial counterpart; Nathaniel Greene, who rose from obscurity to become the finest battlefield commander in Washington’s army; The Marquis de Lafayette, the young Frenchman who brought a soldier’s passion to America; and Benjamin Franklin, a brilliant man of science and philosophy who became the finest statesman of his day. From Nathan Hale to Benedict Arnold, William Howe to “Light Horse” Harry Lee, from Trenton and Valley Forge, Brandywine and Yorktown, the American Revolution’s most immortal characters and poignant moments are brought to life in remarkable Shaara style. Yet, The Glorious Cause is more than just a story of the legendary six-year struggle. It is a tribute to an amazing people who turned ideas into action and fought to declare themselves free. Above all, it is a riveting novel that both expands and surpasses its beloved author’s best work."

After serving a \"juvenile\" life sentence, Yayo is released back to the streets as a full grown man who's on a \"win at all cost\" paper chase. Yayo's once tender heart has been turned ice cold, and he has the mind to match. In a short amount of time, he puts together the Get It Boy Click, and they reign terror throughout the city's drug trade, while Yayo's family prays for him to leave the streets alone. But the addiction to power, fast money and seductive women are hard vices to quit. With rival gangs and gangsta's, along with crooked cops, gunning for their heads, will Yayo and his crew be able to survive the disloyalty and treachery that cause the demise of so many other drug gangs? Or will their blood be the next to soak the streets that they ruthlessly and unapologetically fight to own?"

The book does not romanticize or soften the effects of violence and sickness. One fourth of the child-bearing women in the neighborhoods where these children live test positive for HIV. Pediatric AIDs, life-consuming fires and gang rivalries take a high toll. Several children die during the year in which this narrative takes place. A gently written work, Amazing Grace asks questions that are at once political and theological. What is the value of a child's life? What exactly do we plan to do with those whom we appear to have defined as economically and humanly superfluous? How cold -- how cruel, how tough -- do we dare be?"

At first glance, it's a suicide. But the girl's best friend, a Goth with an attitude named Rhapsody, suspects something different at work. . . One day during detention, Rhapsody shows Jason a crystal that turns her invisible. He tries one on and he jumps over a city. Their classmates, Sasha and Selby, see Jason and Rhapsody in action and receive crystals of their own. They keep a low profile until Jason discovers they are being studied by people they trust. With eleven days until Reject High is destroyed, Jason and his friends must dodge their pursuers, solve the mystery of Cherish’s death, and save their power source from falling into the wrong hands. The first installment in a young adult fantasy series, Reject High combines engaging characters inside of a page-turning adventure. Equal parts sci-fi, fantasy, and action-adventure, Reject High is written from the perspective of Jason Champion, a 15-year old teenager with rage blackouts and a penchant for getting in trouble,"

            "S": "Set in the late Roman Republic, in the first century B.C.E., The Forgotten Legion is a tale of the greatest empire of the ancient world from the perspective of those on the lowest rungs of its society. Romulus and Fabiola are twins, born into slavery to a enslaved mother who is much beloved by them, and much abused by their owner. At 13 years old, they and their mother are sold: Romulus to gladiator school, Fabiola into prostitution, where she will catch the eye of one of the most powerful men in Rome, and their mother into obscurity and death in the salt mines. Tarquinius is an Etruscan, a warrior and soothsayer, born enemy of Rome and trained by the last haruspex in the forgotten arts of divination. A runaway slave, then an AWOL Legionaire, he has a long foretold destiny that will take him to the very ends of the known world. Brennus is a Gaul from the Allobreges tribe. In the battle against the Roman army, his entire family, perhaps his entire tribe, is slaughtered, and only he survives to be sold as a slave to be trained as a gladiator. He rises to become one of the most famous and feared gladiators of his day - and mentor to the boy slave, Romulus, who dreams night and day of escape and of revenge. The lives of these four characters are bound and interwoven in a marvellous story which begins in a Rome riven by corruption, violence and political enmities, but ends far away, where Romulus, Brennus and Tarquinius find themselves fighting against the Parthians and overwhelming odds - survivors of one of the most legendary battles in Roman military history and destined to become part of one of the most compelling, enduring legends: The Forgotten Legion."

            "S": "La biografía definitiva del líder que transformó el mundo, narrada por el Premio Pulitzer, William Taubman. En marzo de 1985, Mijaíl Gorbachov se convirtió en el líder de la Unión Soviética, una de las dos superpotencias mundiales de la guerra fría. Tras seis trepidantes años, sus reformas políticas, la perestroika y la glásnost, destinadas a transformar profundamente el comunismo soviético para salvarlo, condujeron al espectacular e inesperado derrumbe de la URSS y el final de la política de bloques que caracterizó la segunda mitad del siglo XX. Admirado en occidente y denostado en su país, Gorbachov es uno de los personajes clave de nuestra época. En la primera biografía exhaustiva del último gran líder soviético, William Taubman, ganador del premio Pulitzer por su biografía de Kruschev, explica cómo un joven hijo de campesinos se convirtió en máximo dirigente y promesa de renovación del sistema soviético, y cómo encontró un terreno común con el presidente Reagan que puso fin a la tensión de la guerra fría y acabó provocando que la URSS y su imperio se desmoronaran. ¿Fue un líder excepcional o un personaje atrapado por sus propias deficiencias y por el destino al que se enfrentó? A lo largo de estas páginas, Taubman nos perfila todas las facetas de un personaje único y, en palabras del propio Gorbachov, de «difícil comprensión». Basándose en entrevistas con el ex líder soviético, transcripciones y documentos de los archivos rusos, conversaciones con amigos y enemigos y múltiples líderes internacionales, William Taubman nos ofrece en esta monumental biografía un retrato íntimo y honesto, conmovedor, punzante y severo, de un personaje cuya vida podría situarse a la altura de las grandes novelas rusas. Reseñas: «Magistral. [...] Será por mucho tiempo la biografía definitiva de esta fascinante figura.» The New York Times Book Review «Gorbachov, como su Khrushchev, es un logro extraordinario. [...] Repleto de nueva información y juicios inteligentes; un doble triunfo para el género biográfico.» John Lewis Gaddis, ganador del Premio Pulitzer «Una lectura esencial para el siglo XXI.» The New York Times «Taubman aplica una lupa tolstoyana a la historia reciente de Rusia y despliega una especial sensibilidad al analizar una vida que demostraría ser más rica que la política.» The Economist «Una penetrante historia y un fascinante estudio psicológico.» Foreign Affairs Magazine"
